Dear user,

Thank you for downloading the Game Of Life!
In the folder you currently have, there are many types of files, so here I am to help you :)

If you just want to play Conway's Game Of Life, you can do so inmmediatly by clicking on GameOfLife.exe, although you cannot take the .exe file outside from this folder in order for the game to work. If you want to see the icon in your desktop, you can create a desktop shortcut by pressing the right mouse button and selecting "New->Shortcut". You can use the icon I gave you to make it look cooler B)

However, if you feel like changing the code and experimenting with your own stuff, you can do so by simply opening GameOfLife.cpp and all the files inside the include folder.
There is also a folder for all the dependencies SFML has, if you need to add one, idk. I also gave you a MakeFile document so you don't need to have all te dependencies next to your .cpp file. You will need to add the link to your directory where you have the dependencies.

And that's it! If you have any doubt, you can let me now by dropping a comment in my yt channel, Cend++, and I will make sure to answer as soon as possible.

See ya! :)
